</div><h3 id="description">Description</h3>
<p>This <a href="https://krepa098.github.io/projects/robot-control-unit/#p1">[hardware assembly]</a> was made for an indoor differential drive robot with a two-axis gimbal.</p>
<p>At its core is the controller board (center).
It consists of:</p>
<ul>
<li>a STM32F7 MCU</li>
<li>6DOF IMU, 3DOF magnetometer</li>
<li>4x configurable TMC stepper drivers with all bells and whistles hooked up</li>
<li>connectors for an LCD, and several peripherals</li>
<li>2x servo connectors</li>
<li>1x ibus receiver</li>
<li>1x serial connector (SWD + UART) to the onboard computer (Raspberry Pi)</li>
</ul>
<p>The board is programmable remotely via the Raspberry's GPIO port and <code>openocd</code>.
During the development of the robot, this has proven not only to be a huge time saver but it also frees the robot of all wires that would otherwise restrain it in its motion.</p>
<p>Its primary function is to serve as an interface between the onboard computer and the hardware.
It also takes care of all the critical real-time tasks such as step generation (ramp profiles), AHRS updates, reading the remote control inputs, etc.
Finally, it also assumes safety-critical functions such as preventing the robot from driving down a stairwell or colliding with obstacles.</p>
<p>The board is powered by a <a href="https://krepa098.github.io/projects/robot-control-unit/#p2">[5V, 25W buck converter]</a> using the <code>AP64501</code> from Analog Devices, the same chip also used on Raspberry's compute module carrier board.
Power monitoring also takes place here.
Since the robot operates on batteries, it is important to keep track of its voltage and the energy it consumes.</p>
<p>The firmware of this board is a bit unusual and breaks with the custom of being written in the languages traditionally used for embedded systems, namely C or C++.
Instead, it is written from the ground up in <code>rust</code> for two good reasons:</p>
<ol>
<li><strong>correctness</strong>.
Every sufficiently complex software can be affected by <code>memory corruption</code> (e.g., due to a dangling pointer), which is not only hard to spot,  but also extremely challenging to reproduce and debug.
Even worse, it can go unnoticed, until it happens in the field where the system cannot be serviced and/or cause damage.
Of course, rigorous coding discipline and best practices get you pretty far in C/C++, but having the compiler eliminate a whole range of possible bugs is a huge win <em>and a competitive edge</em>.
If it compiles, it works (apart from logic errors).</li>
<li><strong>async</strong>.
Contrary to C/C++, <code>async</code> functionality is a core part of the <code>rust</code> language.
It enables fearless concurrent programming (tasks scheduled by an executor to run on a single core) written as if executed sequentially.
This is beneficial for almost anything IO bound such as web servers, databases, <em>and also embedded systems</em>.
While MCUs have hardware built in (DMA) to offload IO operations and to keep the application running, this can become quite a burden to manage properly often resulting in complex state machines.
By writing this code asynchronously, most of the complexity goes away.
Herein, the <code>rtic</code> framework was used with the <code>embassy-stm32</code> HAL.
The former provides the scaffolding (similar to FreeRTOS), and the latter provides access to the STM32 peripherals and also implements the needed <code>traits</code> for async execution.
Notice that rust async uses cooperative scheduling, as opposed to preemptive scheduling in FreeRTOS.
A noticeable advantage of this approach is that there is no separate stack per task and thus no stack size tuning, faster task switches, and overall better resource utilization <sup class="footnote-reference"><a href="#1">1</a></sup> <sup class="footnote-reference"><a href="#2">2</a></sup>.
A possible downside is that tasks that don't yield can starve other tasks.</li>
<li><strong>tooling</strong>
Embedded rust has some impressive tools and libraries such as <code>defmt</code> for very efficient, lightweight data logging.
<code>embedded-hal</code> enables portability between platforms by providing a set of useful traits.
<code>probe-rs</code> is the de facto standard for flashing and debugging.
<code>defmt-test</code> provides a hardness to run <code>unit tests</code> on bare metal with relative ease.</li>
</ol>
<p>Overall, the embedded rust ecosystem has matured massively over the last couple of years.
Some vendors (espressif and infineon) even started providing official support for their hardware, while others are still a pure community effort (STM32).</p>
